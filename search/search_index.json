A handler is an object that receives the log messages and decides what to do with them. The logging module has several built-in handlers, such as <code>StreamHandler</code>, <code>FileHandler</code>, <code>RotatingFileHandler</code> or <code>TimedRotatingFileHandler</code>.

The log level is used to filter the log messages. The log format is used to format the log messages. You can use the built-in log formats or create your own format by using the <code>Formatter</code> class.
