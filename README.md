# python lessons

During my several years working, my main programming language was python. I've
learned much during this time, and a few lessons were learned, aside from good
practices.

This repository is created to group them into different levels
(beginner, intermediate and advanced). Tests are included, so it is easy to
understand and practice with them.

TODO: Explain repository structure and mkdocs

## Makefile

`make` commands available for easy usage of mkdocs cli explained above.
Run `make` or `make help` for extra support.
