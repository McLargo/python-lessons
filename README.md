# python lessons

During my many years working as developer, my main programming language has been
python. I've learned many cool features during this time, and a few lessons were
learned, in addition to use of good practices.

This repository is created to group some of these lessons into different levels
(beginner, intermediate and advanced). Tests are included, so it is easy to
understand and practice with them.

## Usage

TL;DR: `make install` to install dependencies, `make server` to start mkdocs server to access documentation.

Makefile is your friend. All commands are available through it, so it is quite
easy and friendly usage. Run `make` or `make help` for more information of the
commands to use.
